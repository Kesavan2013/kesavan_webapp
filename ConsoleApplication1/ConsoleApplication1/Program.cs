            Git how to give people push access that needs to be merged in by organizers?

            Ask for the username of the person you're adding as a collaborator. If they don't have one, they can sign up for GitHub.
In the top right corner of any page, click your username.
On your profile page, click the Repositories tab, then click the name of your repository.
In your repository's right sidebar, click Settings.
Click the "Collaborators" tab.
Start typing the collaborator's username.
Select the user from the drop-down menu.
Click Add.
